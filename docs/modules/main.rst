Introduction
------------

The Main board plugs into a Raspberry Pi SBC and provides:

* Touch screen
* Four physical buttons
* Battery backed real-time clock (RTC)
* Battery backed GPS
* Buzzer (from board v0.3 onwards)
* Sensor chain 3.3V and 5V power supply (from board v0.3 this is switched by MOSFETs under software control)
* Connector for cable to :doc:`pea`

Theory of operation
-------------------

The ESDK-MAIN board connects a number of peripherals to a Raspberry Pi P1 GPIO header including a 320x240 touchscreen over SPI and I2C, a battery-backed RTC connected over I2C, a GPS module connected over a UART (also supporting a 5V active antenna), four front panel buttons connected to GPIO lines, 3.3V and 5V sensor power rails switched by MOSFETs (from board v0.3 onwards), an on-board "HAT" EEPROM connected over I2C and USB-C for 5V power input.

The LCD, touchscreen, RTC and HAT EEPROM connect to I2C 0 on the Raspberry Pi, whereas the sensor string is connected to I2C 1 â€” this separation aims to avoid issues with the sensor string affecting operation of "system" devices. LCD backlight control is supported in software with further tweaks to the device tree overlay; GPIO 12 does support PWM to be able to adjust the brightness.

A 8-pin Molex PicoBlade connector is present for connection to the ESDK-PEA board that provides an external connector for the sensor modules.

For potential future use, a 5-pin Molex Pico-Lock connector can be used to enable battery expansion. This connector features the 5V rail inbound from the USB-C port, a 5V rail that heads out to the board plus a connection to I2C 0 for smart battery monitoring.
