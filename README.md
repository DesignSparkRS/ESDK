# Environmental Sensor Development Kit (ESDK)

The Environmental Sensor Development Kit (ESDK) is an open source hardware
platform that is designed to make it as easy as possible to prototype custom
sensor solutions. It has been created to support the engineer activism Air
Quality project, but could easily be put to use in other sensing projects â€” and
for that matter, potentially a great many more IoT and wider applications that
have a need for a small Linux computer with integrated touchscreen and GPS etc.
